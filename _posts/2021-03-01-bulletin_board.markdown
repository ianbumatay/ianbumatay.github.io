Every week flatiron school sends us a weekly update asking what advice would you give your self on day 1. 
Since this will be my final blog for the curriculum, I decided to write a blog about it.

First advice  I would give my self is to take some rest in between. Take a break and relax, when you get overwhelmed, stop and do something to refresh your mind, then go back to work. Without it, you will be stressed out and you may not be able to accomplish things efficiently. Taking some rest will make you more work efficient.

Second advice I would give my self is to focus.  While working on my labs or  just reading through materials. Focusing for two hours(free of noise working on your own work space) gets more work done rather than 3 or 4  hours of  multi tasking. 

Third is to persevere. Learning new things is hard especially in a short period of time. I have to learn the ability to keep doing something in spite of obstacles. 

Lastly, with my newly acquired skills, it is important to never stop learning. The world of technology is  a career path of an ever changing education. So I need to embrace changes and the willingness to learn new things.
