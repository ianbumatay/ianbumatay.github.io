***if I could compare my first month of  learning software engineer to a boxing match. My first month would be the first of twelve rounds. During the first round I have full of energy and optism untill I get punch in the face. Boom! Welcome to your FIRST MILE a two weeks of learning Procedural Ruby. Ting ting ting!  Deadline is coming up! Stress receptors pumping up, anxiety lingering my ears. I almost got knocked out

**And now  I am in my second month Iâ€™m getting beaten up again. With  my first project coming up and un finished labs pilling up I am on the same situation again.. But the crazy thing in all of these is  the harder it gets and the more I learn about programming the more I fall in love with it. I know there going to be more time like this and its gonna get more harder but  if you "Choose a Job You Love, and You Will Never Have To Work a Day in Your Life"
