I decided to learn software engineering because of 3 reasons;

First and most practical reason;  itâ€™s one of the most in-demand skills in the world.

Second,  fast and flexible way to change career. I am a part time options trader and a stay at home dad. Being able to learn Software Engineering part time in my own pace in less than a year is a win win situation. 

Lastly, learning to code and  to become  a Software Engineer is more than a job.  it's just the begining of a life long profession that I wanted to grow into. I wanted to build something from scratch; something creative, I dont know what it is. But I wanted to put my creativity to work. I believe that being a Developer  and learning how to code will give me limitless opportunity to the things that I wanted to do.
